## About This Template
This template builds upon the template currently available in Yeoman, but utilizes WebPack in conjunction with the latest available versions (a/o 10/2019) of Gulp and Babel.

Typescript support can easily be added by modifying the webpack config and uncommenting the typescript support section.
